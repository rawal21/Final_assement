        CentralAxis’s Power Resource Mapping solution addresses a critical inefficiency in data center operations. Traditionally, data centers overprovision their energy supply, paying for significantly more power than they use on average to accommodate potential spikes. Our innovative approach allows you to operate closer to 100% of your energy capacity daily, dramatically reducing costs without compromising reliability.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        During peak demand, our system instantly taps into alternative energy reserves, ensuring uninterrupted operation while maintaining optimal efficiency. This flexible and responsive approach translates to significant savings and improved sustainability for your data center.
